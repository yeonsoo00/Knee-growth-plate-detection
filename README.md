# Knee-growth-plate-detection
detecting multiple signals of knee growth plate

kneegrowthplate.ipynb will help you to guide how to generate a target line.
There are different thresholds on each signal. So user has to test with various thresholds.
There are also py files for some signals. By migrating these files, user can also generate py files to make all procedure automated.
